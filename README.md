## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Yarn package manager
- MySQL Server (running locally)

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies for both client and server using Yarn Workspaces.

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install
````

### 3\. Database Setup

1.  Create an empty database in MySQL (e.g., `quickcart_db`).
2.  Configure the environment variables in `server/prisma/.env`:

<!-- end list -->

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:3306/quickcart_db"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
```

3.  Run migrations and seed the database:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Create tables
yarn prisma:migrate

# Seed data (Admin, Driver, Products, Stock)
yarn seed
```

-----

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

You need two terminal windows to run the full stack.

**Terminal 1: Backend API**

```bash
yarn dev:server
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

**Terminal 2: Frontend App**

```bash
yarn dev:client
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```
